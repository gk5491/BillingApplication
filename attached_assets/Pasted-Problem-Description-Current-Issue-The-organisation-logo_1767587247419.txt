Problem Description (Current Issue):
The organisation logo uploaded from Settings → Organisation Logo is not being applied in generated documents, specifically:
Customer Statement (Sales → Customers → Statement)
Vendor Statement (Purchases → Vendors → Statement)
Print / PDF preview
Email-sent statements
Instead of the configured logo, the statement UI shows “No Logo” or an empty placeholder, even though a logo is already uploaded and saved in settings.
This indicates a broken data flow between organisation settings and statement rendering.
Expected Behavior (What MUST Happen):
The logo uploaded in Settings → Organisation → Logo should act as the single source of truth.
That logo must automatically appear in:
Customer Statement header
Vendor Statement header
PDF downloads
Print previews
Email attachments
No manual logo upload should be required per statement.
If the logo is updated in settings, all statements must reflect the new logo instantly.
Functional Requirements:
Fetch organisation logo dynamically from the settings table/config/API.
Inject the logo into the statement header section (top-left or defined brand position).
Ensure consistency across:
On-screen UI
Print view
PDF export
Email attachment
If logo is missing:
Show a clean fallback (organisation name text)
DO NOT show “No Logo” placeholder in production UI.
Technical Expectations (High-Level, No Code):
Ensure the statement component/service reads logo data from organisation settings, not hardcoded or local state.
Confirm logo URL/path is:
Persisted correctly after upload
Accessible publicly or via authorized fetch
Verify logo binding exists in:
Customer Statement template
Vendor Statement template
PDF generation template
Avoid duplication:
❌ Do not store logo separately for customers/vendors
✅ Use organisation-level logo only
Edge Cases to Handle:
Logo updated → existing statements should reflect new logo
Logo removed → fallback text appears gracefully
PDF export matches preview exactly (no missing logo)
Email-sent PDF includes logo
Different screen sizes should not break logo alignment
Acceptance Criteria (Very Important):
Upload logo once in Settings → Organisation Logo
Open any Customer or Vendor Statement
Logo must be visible immediately without refresh hacks
Downloaded PDF must match UI preview
Same logo must appear everywhere, consistently
